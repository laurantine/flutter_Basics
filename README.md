# Summary

Introduction to building user interfaces in a flutter app.

## Building UI with Widgets

- Flutter uses a widget-based approach to building user interfaces. Everything in Flutter is a widget, from simple elements like buttons and text to more complex layouts.
  
- There are two types of widgets: StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.
  
  - StatelessWidget: A widget that does not change over time (immutable). For example, a button or a text label.

  - StatefulWidget: A widget that can change over time (mutable). For example, a checkbox or a form.
 
- Flutter provides a wide range of pre-built widgets that you can use to create your app's user interface.

      -  Container:

A widget that allows you to customize its child widget's appearance by setting properties like width, height, padding, margin, and background color.

     - Text:

A widget that displays a text string on the screen. You can customize the text's style, such as font size, color, and alignment.

     - Images

A widget that displays an image from various sources, such as the local file system or the internet. You can control the image's size, alignment, and other properties. 

      -AppBar:

A widget that displays a navigation bar at the top of the screen. It typically contains a title, action buttons, and other optional elements.

    -Scaffold:

A widget that provides a basic structure for your app's layout. It includes features like an AppBar, a body for displaying content, and optional elements like drawers and bottom navigation bars.
