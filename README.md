# Summary

Introduction to building user interfaces in a flutter app.

## Building UI with Widgets

- Flutter uses a widget-based approach to building user interfaces. Everything in Flutter is a widget, from simple elements like buttons and text to more complex layouts.
  
- There are two types of widgets: StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.
  
  - StatelessWidget: A widget that does not change over time (immutable). For example, a button or a text label.

  - StatefulWidget: A widget that can change over time (mutable). For example, a checkbox or a form.
